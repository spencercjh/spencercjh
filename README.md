### Hi there 👋

My Chinese resume: [Github Page](https://spencercjh.github.io/resume/)

- 🔭 Because of interest in software development and curiosity in technique, I have multiple internships during recent years at school. It makes me to be a junior back-end developer interested in microservice framework, K8s and system architecture.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying software engineering at Shanghai University for master degree. My research direction is distributed machine learning. Keyword: Parameter Server, ADMM, Horovod, XDL.
- 💬 Discuss with me about Java^8, [Micronaut](http://micronaut.io/), Spring, gRPC, RESTful, MySQL, Docker, K8s...Or teatch me to write Go, Python or Cpp. xD
- 📫 How to reach me: shouspencercjh@foxmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: 🚴‍♂️, ⚽(GK🥅), 🏓, 🏸

Now I am bothered by the tedious and boring affairs in school, so I am much less active on Github and coding.😭
